But their plan should not be. Taken and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 men are now waiting for expulsion, prevented from leaving their fortune prison by armed soldiers. The conditions of the warehouse are more and more desperate. Several days ago, the authorities have stopped distributing food and basic supplies. ""I came from Djibouti at work. They gave us small amounts of food. If there is no food, we will die,"" said a migrant who refused to give his name. ""If there is no solution, they will deport us to our countries or we will go out of here,"" the man added. Yemen, the poorest country of the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom flee hunger and violence. The itinerary was dangerous well before Yemen went down in the war of any release in 2015. Hundreds of people drown each year on the journey of the Perilous Sea and those who face multiple risks, including death by ""Aggression, extortion and abuse of criminal networks, as well as the dangers arising from the war in Yemen"", according to UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency.

A department manager told Reuters that the goal of the move to a new facility had been to improve the conditions of migrants while they are waiting for their expulsion. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of most Arab allies of the Gulf are fighting to restore the exiled government from Yemen to power and pick up the houthi movement aligned with Iran. Although the Government controls Nominally Aden and other regions of the South, a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean that its officials reside mainly abroad. State services and wages have been affected by Chaos and African migrants appear to be a lower priority.

But their plan was not to be . Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities , the 600 or so men now await deportation , prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers . Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate . Several days ago , the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies . "" I came from Djibouti to work . They used to give us small amounts of food . If there is no food , we will die , "" said one migrant who declined to give his name . "" If there is no solution , they will deport us to our countries or get us out of here "" , the man added . Yemen , the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula , has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa , many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence .

Despite these dangers , the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily , to 117,000 in 2016 from 92,000 in 2015 , according to UNHCR . Khaled al-Elwany , a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries , says up to 15,000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month . Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies . A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation . Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen 's exiled government to power and roll back the Iran-aligned Houthi movement . While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas , a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad .

But their plan didn't have to be. Captured and held by the authorities of Yemeni, men 600 or less now await deportation, prevented to leave their prison of luck by armed soldiers. The conditions of the warehouse grow increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped distributing food and basic supplies. ""I came from Djibouti to work. They were used to give us small amounts of food. If there is no food, we will die,"" said a migrant who refused to give him the name. ""If there are no solutions, they will give us in our countries or take us out here,"" the man added. Yemen, the poorest country of the Arabica peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and eastern African refugees, many of whom were fleeing hunger and violence.

Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling through the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea for Yemen is constantly increasing, at 117,000 in 2016 from 92,000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled Al-Elwany, a local official who up to a short time has supervised the deportation of migrants to their countries of origin, says up to 15,000 migrants are arrested in the city's control places every month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry to refuse to collaborate with a plan to move the center to a nearby province and after the authorities stopped food supplies. An official of the ministry told Reuters that the purpose of the move to a new structure had been to improve the conditions for migrants while waiting for deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of allies for most of the Arab Gulf are fighting to restore the exiled Government of Yemen to power and bring the movement of Houthi aligned by Iran. While the government nominally controls aden and other southern areas, an economic crisis and rivalry with local armed groups mean that its officials reside mostly abroad. State services and salaries were affected by chaos, and African migrants seem to be a lower priority.

But their plan should not have been. Caught and detained by Yemen, 600 or men who now expect deportation, prevented their improvisant prison by armed soldiers. The conditions in the warehouse is increasing more and more desperate. A few days ago, the authorities stopped transmitting food and basic deliveries. ""I came from Djibouti to work.
